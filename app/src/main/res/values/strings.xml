        1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper. In a food processor with the S blade attached, process the pistachios, oats, and salt for about 30 seconds, until a meal starts to form. Drizzle in the maple syrup and olive oil while the motor is still running and the meal begins to come together into a crumbly, almost-wet dough.\n\n
        2. Press the dough evenly into the pan and cover it with coconut flakes and remaining pistachios. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the coconut is nice and golden brown and the dough is cooked through. You want the squares to still be a little soft don\'t overbake these.\n\n
        3. Carefully lift the cooled dough out of the pan by holding two sides of the parchment paper. Cut it into squares. Drizzle a little maple syrup over the top for extra sweetness, if you like. Store the squares in a sealed container for up to a week.

        3. In a small food processor, pulse the walnuts, cacao powder, and sea salt until the walnuts are well chopped. Add the dates and pulse to combine, adding 2 tablespoons water if the blade gets stuck. Process until smooth, then spread onto the cookie layer. Sprinkle with sea salt if desired. Freeze for 30 minutes (this will help them firm up, making them easier to cut). Remove and slice into bars. Store remaining bars in the fridge.\n \n
        4. Finished bars can also be frozen. Let each bar thaw for about 15 minutes at room temperature.

        3. In a large mixing bowl sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the butter. Using your hands or a pastry cutter, work in the butter until the mixture resembles pea-sized crumbles. Add the egg, vanilla, and cooled cream. Stir just until the dough comes together. Fold in the blueberries.\n \n
        4. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Using your hands or a rolling pin, shape into a disk 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut into 8 even wedges. Arrange wedges on the prepared baking sheet, brush the tops with cream. Sprinkle with sugar, if desired.\n \n
        5. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown. Let cool for 15 minutes on a rack before serving.
